# Version Management

**Due to the varying development progress of different iLogtail plugins, we categorize their statuses into four stages: Alpha, Beta, Stable, and Deprecated. Users can find the plugin's status on its respective documentation page, helping them make better choice for their solutions.**

## Alpha

**Any code submitted through initial PRs enters this phase. A plugin at this stage is minimally functional and can be used in non-critical scenarios, but it may have the following issues:**

1. Plugin configurations are subject to change and may not be backward-compatible.
2. The plugin may have functional errors and performance issues. Users can report them to the community, but they may not receive immediate attention.

## Beta

**Once an Alpha plugin has been running stably in some non-critical scenarios for a while, it advances to the Beta stage. At this stage, the plugin is generally ready for stable use, but it may still have the following:**

1. Configurations can be fine-tuned, with backward compatibility guaranteed.
2. The plugin may still have minor functional errors and performance issues. After users report them, the maintainers will respond promptly.

## Stable

**A plugin enters the Stable phase when it meets the following criteria:**

1. It has been used by a significant number of community users in production environments without any reported issues.
2. The plugin's functionality is complete, with no new related issues reported and no unresolved bugs.

## Deprecated

**When a plugin is marked as Deprecated, it will be removed in a future version. The community will no longer respond to new issues related to it. For more information, please refer to the plugin's documentation.**
